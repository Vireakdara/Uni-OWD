# YOLO-UniOW: Efficient Universal Open-World Object Detection

## Overview
**YOLO-UniOW** introduces **Universal Open-World Object Detection (Uni-OWD)**, unifying **open-vocabulary detection (OVD)** and **open-world detection (OWOD)** into a single framework. It addresses the limitations of traditional detectors (fixed vocabularies) and multimodal models (high computational costs) by enabling:
- Detection of **known** and **unknown** objects (labeled as "unknown").
- Dynamic vocabulary expansion without retraining.
- Real-time inference (up to **69.6 FPS** on V100 GPUs).
